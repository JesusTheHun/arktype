Do you want to write types like `type('UserId[]')` ?   
Arktype offers the concept of `Scope`, and they are for you.

## Introduction

When you create a type with `type('string')`, `string` is actually the name of a type in something called a `Scope`.  
The `type` object uses the default scope, so you can use all built-in types immediately.

```ts
import type { PredicateCast } from "@ark/schema" 
import { scope, type } from "arktype"

type UserId = `user__${string}`;

const isUserId: PredicateCast<string, UserId> = (v, ctx): v is UserId => {
	if (v.startsWith('user__')) {
		return true
	}

	return ctx.mustBe('a UserId')
}

// ---cut-before---
const userScope = scope({
	UserId: type('string').satisfying(isUserId),
	memberships: { '[UserId]': { joinedAt: 'number.epoch' }}
});
```

You may have discovered a new syntax to define records or object with index signature.  
We can't use `type.Record` when using a type defined in the very scope we are creating.

By using the new syntax, we were able to use the type `UserId` defined in the same scope.

## Building around scopes

Once you have defined a scope, its type are tied to it.  
But you probably want to use them in other places. To do that, export them :
```ts
import { PredicateCast } from "@ark/schema" 
import { scope, type } from "arktype"

type UserId = `user__${string}`;

const isUserId: PredicateCast<string, UserId> = (v, ctx): v is UserId => {
	if (v.startsWith('user__')) {
		return true
	}

	return ctx.mustBe('a UserId')
}

const userScope = scope({
	UserId: type('string').satisfying(isUserId),
	memberships: { '[UserId]': { joinedAt: 'number.epoch' }}
});

declare const data: unknown;

// ---cut-before---
export const userTypes = userScope.export();

// Building another scope
const teamScope = scope({
	members: userTypes.UserId.array()
})

// ...or validating some data
const memberships = userTypes.memberships.assert(data);
```
